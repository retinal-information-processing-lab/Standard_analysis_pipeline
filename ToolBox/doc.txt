The goal of this folder is to provide several tools fo you to use at different stages of your analysis.It is mostly 
small independant and easy to use notebook doing one specific task of the analysis for example you will find a 
notebook that allows you to plot a channel from a recording for you to perform a sanity check. Use this as you new 
for debugging. It may not be as efficient as using the whole pipeline but it should be simpler for specific task. If
you feel an other task could be added in the folder with the same phylosophie, feel free to add more notebooks.
