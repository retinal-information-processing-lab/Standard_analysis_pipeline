# Standard_analysis_pipeline
A repo with all the code you need to go from your raw files to hundreds of fully characterized ganglion cells


Once downloaded the repository all the code runs in python. A standard anaconda distribution with few dependencies will do. The installation of spyking interface is required. The use of jupyter is advised but not necessary. 

## Installation
Once you have your Anaconda distribution for python (you can find here the ones you need depending on your OS: https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads) you need to create an environment (here how to do it: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands) and to install spike interface in it (here how to do it: https://spikeinterface.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). It works with Anaconda 4.11.0 and python 3.9.16

#All the dependencies needed are basic and should be already present in the python distribution of choice.

The analysis of this pipeline are nice and most of all are free. Take advantage of them!
